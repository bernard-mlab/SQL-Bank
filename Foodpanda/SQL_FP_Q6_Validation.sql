Q6. Whatâ€™s the conversion rate from the shop list page to the shop details page?
Approach:
i)  get sessions where 'shop_list.loaded' hits is captured
ii) identify sessions from (i) where 'shop_details.loaded' is captured after 'shop_list.loaded'
    'shop_details.loaded' tag that are fired before 'shop_details.loaded' would not be counted
iii) get distinct visits to the shop details page and shop listing page within a session. (conversion rate)
